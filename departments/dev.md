Welcome to the engine room of GDG Ghardaia! In the Development department, we are the builders. We turn ideas into reality. Whether it’s a website that connects people or a mobile app that solves a daily problem, we are the ones who write the logic that makes it work. You don’t need to be a math genius to start—just bring your curiosity and readiness to solve problems!

## 1. The Foundation (For All Department Members)
Before diving into code, every member of the Development Department masters the "Developer's Lifestyle":
- **Version Control (Git & GitHub)**: You will stop sending zip files named "Final_Project_v2". You will learn how real engineering teams collaborate, merge code, and fix conflicts using Git.
- **Project Conception**: Coding is the last step. You will learn to plan first—using technical diagrams, understanding requirements, and writing documentation so you know exactly *what* to build.
- **Environment Setup**: Setting up VS Code and GitHub Desktop to create a professional workspace.

## 2. The Specializations (Choose Your Path)
After the basics, you will focus on one of these three tracks:

### Track A: Web Development
* **Focus**: Building the visual and interactive parts of websites (Frontend).
* **What you will do**: Mastering the trio of the web (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) and understanding deployment.
* **Key Projects**:
    - Practice: Designing and coding a personal Landing Page.
    - Teamwork: Uploading and deploying a collaborative project to GitHub.
    - Competition: "Best Landing Page" challenge (Design & Code).

### Track B: Mobile Development
* **Focus**: Creating native Android applications for the world's most popular mobile OS.
* **What you will do**: Learning Kotlin (Google's preferred programming language), designing XML layouts, and understanding Object-Oriented Programming (OOP).
* **Key Projects**:
    - Learning the Android Studio environment.
    - Building a functional Android app from scratch.
    - Competition: Developing a creative Mini-Project App.

### Track C: Algorithms
* **Focus**: Strengthening your logic and problem-solving muscle.
* **What you will do**: Using the C language to master data structures, loops, and variables (aligned with the University program).
* **Key Projects**:
    - Solving complex logic puzzles in code.
    - Optimizing code for speed and efficiency.
    - Interactive Problem-Solving Workshops.

## 3. What You Will Learn
- **Collaboration**: How to work in a team where many people write code for the same project without breaking it.
- **Translation**: How to look at a designer's image and translate it into functional code.
- **Algorithmic Thinking**: Learning how to break a big, scary problem into small, solvable steps.
- **Deployment**: Writing code is one thing; putting it online for the world to see is another skill you will master.

## 4. Contribution to the Club
- You bring the Design team's vision to life; without you, their designs are just pictures.
- You build the actual platforms and tech solutions that represent the club.
- You prove the technical capability of GDG Ghardaia by shipping working software.
- helping other students troubleshoot errors creates a culture of mutual support.
- Strengthening the university community's grasp on academic subjects (via the Algorithms track).

## 5. Career Impact (Future Jobs)
- **Frontend Developer**: Building websites for companies or freelancers.
- **Android Developer**: A highly specialized role with strong demand in the mobile market.
- **Software Engineer**: The algorithmic foundation is the key to passing interviews at major tech companies (Google, Amazon, etc.).

## 6. Tools Needed
- VS Code (Visual Studio Code)
- Git & GitHub Desktop
- Android Studio
- JDK (Java Development Kit)
- Code::Blocks (For C programming)
