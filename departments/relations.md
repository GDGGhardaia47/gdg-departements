Welcome to the voice and heartbeat of GDG Ghardaia! In the Relations department, we are the bridge between our tech team and the outside world. We are the ones who find the opportunities (sponsors, speakers, companies, ...), fill the seats, and make sure the events actually happen smoothly. You don't need to write code here—you need to know how to talk to people, manage chaos, and sell a vision.

## 1. The Foundation (For All Department Members)
Before specializing, every member of the Relations Department masters the art of professional management:
- **Professional Communication**: You will unlearn "texting" habits and learn how to write high-stakes business emails, structure proposals, and present the GDG value proposition clearly.
- **Google Workspace Mastery**: We run on Google products. You will master Docs, Sheets, and Slides not just for homework, but for real-time collaboration and project management.
- **GDG Branding**: Understanding who we are, what we stand for, and how to represent the global Google Developer Group identity correctly.
