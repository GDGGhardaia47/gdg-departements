Welcome to the digital headquarters of GDG Ghardaia! The Media department is not just about making videos; we are the voice, the face, and the heartbeat of the club online. We manage the entire digital ecosystem (Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, YouTube, Discord). If a member asks a question, we answer. If an event is happening, we are live-streaming it. We "own" the internet for the club.

## 1. The Foundation (For All Department Members)
Before choosing a specialty, every member of the Media Department masters the "Community First" mindset:
- **Platform Mastery**: You will learn the technical ins and outs of our ecosystem: Facebook/Instagram/TikTok (Announcements/Visuals), YouTube (Education), and Discord (Community).
- **The Media Pack**: You will learn how Photo, Video, and Text work together to create a cohesive campaign.
- **Engagement Discipline**: Understanding that "posting" is only 20% of the job. The other 80% is replying to comments, sharing stories, and keeping the Discord server alive.
